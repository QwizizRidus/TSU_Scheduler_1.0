# TSU_Scheduler_1.0

<div>
TSU_Scheduler - one of my first applications made for android. It was created without usage of any VCS so now it is uploaded here by single commit just as an example
of my codding practice. 
<br></br>
TSU_Scheduler was rewritten and redesigned. Actual version of the application is <a href ="https://github.com/QwizizRidus/TSU_Schedule">here</a>
